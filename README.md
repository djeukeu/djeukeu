Hi 👋 I'm Djeukeu 
==============================


I am a Cameroonian software developer currently based in the UK. During my time at university, I was always curious to solve real life problems through programming. In June 2021, I started an internship at Arrah Solution, where I was introduced to mobile and web application development, which was the beginning of my journey in the tech industry. At Arrah Solution, I quickly became interested in cloud computing technologies such as AWS. So, in my spare time, I decided to learn more by attending online courses on AWS and Docker & Kubernetes.

I am meticulous, organised and a Certified Cloud Practitioner with 2+ years of experience in defining requirements, designing, implementing and deploying applications using various technologies.

As a developer, I like to learn new technologies, regardless of the area of expertise, be it mobile development, front-end development, back-end development, database management, UI/UX design and cloud computing.In addition, I gain most of my experience and skills by taking online courses, working on side projects, and even being a web developer instructor at GetSmarter. I also like to try new tricks on my side projects.
